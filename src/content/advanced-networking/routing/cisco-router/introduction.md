# Introduction to Cisco Router

## 1. Description of a router

The main job of a router is to forward packets based upon a routing table. Every router has at least two IP addresses. It's a characteristic of how routers do their jobs. The routers IP addresses are typically the default gateways to PCs and servers or other networking devices. Routers implement layer 3 or network layer functions.

Routers can connect to service providers and act as gateways to other networks, typically found at the perimeter or edge of the network.

Routers don't always have ethernet interfaces. Gateway routers can connect to external network through serial interfaces, DSL connections, and other forms of WAN.

The main internal components of a router are similar to those of any computing device: CPU, motherboard, RAM, ROM. Cisco routers have different types of memory. They also have flash, where the image of the operating system resides.
