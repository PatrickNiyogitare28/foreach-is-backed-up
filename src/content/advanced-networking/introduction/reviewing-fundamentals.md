# Reviewing the Fundamentals of Networking
<br><br>
Fundamentals of Networking covers the fundamentals of local area networking, defining networks with the OSI Model and understanding wired and wireless networks. In addition it includes understanding Internet Protocol, implementing TCP/IP and working with networking services. It is an opportunity for learners to better understand wide area networks, network infrastructures, and network security.

At the end of Fundamentals of Networking, a learner will be able to:
